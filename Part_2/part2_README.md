# CS523-Project 2 part 2

########### Description ##########

This is part 2 of project 2 of Advanced topics on PETS.
We did a jupyter notebook file to extract and show a private user's data from csv files.

########### Description of the files ##########

The second part contains four files

Data files:
- pois.csv
- queries.csv

Code files:
- grid.py
- part2_data_extraction.ipynb

Our jupyter book has functions to analyze the data (get location, get ip address and all information we can get corresponding to these ip addresses), as well as code to draw graphs to show user's different location (home or work) and their POIs.


########### Running the program ##########

Make sure you have every file cited above in the same folder. Open the jupyter notebook and run all cells one after another. You can choose the number of users you want in te graph or in the table, as well as you can choose to save images to your computer. In order to do that, uncomment or change the corresponding lines in the code.

########### Have a great day :) ##########
