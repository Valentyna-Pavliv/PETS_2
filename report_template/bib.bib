	abstract = {Digital signature is a fundamental primitive with numerous applications. Following the development of pairing-based cryptography, several taking advantage of this setting have been proposed. Among them, the Camenisch-Lysyanskaya (CL) signature scheme is one of the most ﬂexible and has been used as a building block for many other protocols. Unfortunately, this scheme suﬀers from a linear size in the number of messages to be signed which limits its use in many situations.},
